Dental suturing is not only a technical skill but also an art that requires practice and experience. The oral surgeon or general dentist should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each suturing technique and choose the most appropriate one for each clinical situation. The choice of suturing technique depends on several factors, such as the type and location of the wound, the amount of tension and mobility of the tissues, the aesthetic and functional outcomes, and the patient's comfort and compliance.
 
Some of the benefits of dental suturing are[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]:
 
- It supports the coaptation of tissue margins until they heal by primary intention, which reduces bone loss, scarring, infection and inflammation.
- It aids in hemostasis by compressing blood vessels and preventing bleeding and hematoma formation.
- It reduces postoperative pain and discomfort by stabilizing the tissues and preventing their movement and irritation.
- It enhances the aesthetic and functional outcomes by preserving the contour and architecture of the tissues and preventing wound dehiscence and contracture.
- It may help to retain blood clot or clotting aids in the socket after tooth extraction, which is important for preventing dry socket and promoting healing.

However, dental suturing also has some drawbacks and risks that should be considered[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^]:

- It may cause tissue trauma and necrosis if the sutures are placed too tightly, too deeply or too close to the tissue edges.
- It may cause infection and inflammation if the sutures are contaminated or left in place for too long.
- It may cause allergic or foreign body reactions if the suture material is not biocompatible or resorbable.
- It may cause difficulty in oral hygiene and plaque accumulation if the sutures are not properly trimmed or secured.
- It may require additional visits for suture removal or adjustment if the sutures are not self-dissolving or self-adjusting.

Therefore, dental suturing should be performed with care and precision, following the general principles and guidelines for each technique. The oral surgeon or general dentist should also educate the patient about the postoperative care and instructions for suture management, such as avoiding trauma, infection, smoking, alcohol, spicy foods, rinsing, brushing or flossing at the suture site. The patient should also be informed about the signs and symptoms of complications that may require immediate attention, such as bleeding, swelling, pain, fever, pus or foul odor. The patient should also be scheduled for follow-up visits to monitor the healing process and remove or adjust the sutures as needed.
